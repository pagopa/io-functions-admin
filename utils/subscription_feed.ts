/**
 * Updates the subscrption status of a user.
 *
 * User subscribed or unsubscribed events are stored as empty entities in an
 * Azure storage table.
 *
 * The entity key is composed by the day of the event, the service ID (if it's
 * a service subscription event), a character that indicates whether it's a
 * subscribed (S) or unsubscribed (U) event and the SHA256 hash of the fiscal
 * code of the user.
 *
 * For each day, (optionally) service and user, either the S or the U key exist,
 * but not both (it would not make sense).
 *
 * When the key does not include a service ID, it refers to a profile
 * subscription event, meaning the user registered to IO (subscribed) or deleted
 * her account (unsubscribed).
 * When the key includes the service ID, it refers to a service subscription
 * event, meaning the user activated (subscribed) or deactivated (unsubscribed)
 * a specific service.
